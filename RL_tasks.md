* Immitation learning from expert trajectories of observations only (no expert actions or rewards)
* Immitation learning when the demo is a human and the agent is a robot
* RL under various environment changes (for example, different background patterns, adding a speed indicator on the screen)
* RL against adversarial changes in observation
* RL with good representation that can be used across multiple games
* Cooperation to achieve complicated tasks with simple agents in multi-agent environments
* Solving an environment using different solutions
